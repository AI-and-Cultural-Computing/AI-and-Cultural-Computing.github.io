# Technical Introduction to AI
**(ranging from beginner to advanced; prerequisites noted)**

There are many free and accessible AI courses, tools and libraries that allow you to leverage AI models & technology with or without getting into the nitty gritty of the math and model development. Many of these resources assume minimal programming knowledge and high-school level maths. Unlike the previous resources, these delve into technical topics and may include problem-solving activities. Some of these learning resources have more advanced prerequisites (which will be noted - see [AI prerequisites](/AI_Prerequisites) section for where to gain these skills).
