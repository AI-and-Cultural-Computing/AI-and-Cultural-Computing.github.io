Helpful Prerequisites & Tools for AI Development

If you are struggling with some of the ML resources, or wish to gain further insight into the mechanics of ML, or expand your skills more generally (ex. in order to build your own models or better articulate/understand ML concepts) here is a list of some of the fundamental skills / topics that provide a good foundation. Each section starts with the most pertinent general tools/topics, then progresses into more niche subjects. Wherever possible, multiple resources are recommended for each topic, presuming various levels of math/programming experience.

# **Programming**

* **Command Line** (basic navigation, file & folder manipulation & editing comes in handy when dealing with code and data)
    * Unique to Mac / Linux / Windows OS ([Quick Command Line Tutorial that covers all 3](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/))
  
* **Python** (or other programming language that supports ML libraries - Python is by far the most popular - and you will see it in many tutorials and examples)
    * Basic Concepts: Functions, loops, conditionals, variables, lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.

## Data Collection & Manipulation: 
A large part of building AI models is aquiring and pre-processing data to train on. Knowing how to source, clean, and organize data is an essential skill.
  * **Libraries:** ML requires the input and processing of data, so it is helpful to be familiar with relevant libraries (Data Science programming courses will introduce you to these tools, or you can learn the libraries independently).
      * Super quick [numPy](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/numpy_ultraquick_tutorial.ipynb?utm_source=mlcc&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mlcc-prework&hl=en), [Pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/pandas_dataframe_ultraquick_tutorial.ipynb?utm_source=mlcc&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mlcc-prework&hl=en) tutorials (2 heavily used DS libraries for Python)
